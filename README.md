Front End Permissions
=====================

A Permission Key Category name Front End Permissions for site building

### This Package Does Nothing
This package essentially installs a Permission Key Category named "Front End Permissions" with a handle front\_end.

The reason it is here is that it is to avoid tacking on permissions to Task Permissions for use in the front end of the site.
